Appendix A: File formats recommendations
----------------------------------------


Please consult the `list of recommended file formats of the Library
of Congress <https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/index.html>`_. If in
doubt, get in touch with the `Eawag Research Data Management Project
\<rdm@eawag.ch\> <rdm@eawag.ch>`_.

Some hints
^^^^^^^^^^

* Microsoft Word (:file:`.doc`, :file:`.docx`) and Microsoft Powerpoint (:file:`ppt`, :file:`pptx`)
   Save as PDF/A.

* Microsoft Excel (:file:`.xls`, :file:`.xlsx`)
   Export to CSV.

   If you use Excel for data entry and storage, and follow the advice
   in the excellent guide `Data organization in spreadsheets
   <https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3183v1>`_, export to CSV
   will pose no problems. Consider using `xlstocsv
   <https://github.com/eawag-rdm/xlsxtocsv>`_ for doing that reliably
   and comfortably.

   If you rely on Excel for data organization, annotation,
   visualization, analysis or if you use macros or any advanced
   features, it is likely not possible to export to a format suited
   for sharing and preservation. In this case, save as :file:`xlsx`
   (not :file:`xls`) and hope for the best.
