Eawag DMP Guide
===============
	  
Instructions for creating data management plans for SNSF proposals 
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Version 1.0**


.. sidebar:: Disclaimer

    The instructions in this document are provided in the hope that
    they are useful to prepare the research data management plan
    that is required by the SNSF to be submitted along with project
    applications in mySNF starting Octber 2017. This guide is in part
    Eawag-specific.

    .. warning::
       
        **This document was not vetted by the SNSF, use at your own
        risk.**

	
Structure
^^^^^^^^^

The structure of the document follows the mySNF form for the data management plan.

  **3. Data storage and preservation**
  
  3.1. How will your data be stored and backed-up?
    
  3.2 What is your data preservation plan?


Help text by the SNSF is quoted at the beginning of each section in a grey box.

.. admonition:: SNSF
	:class: halfwidth admonition-snsf
		
        The SNSF explains how the question is meant.

	  
Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instructions contain step-by-step guidance on how to produce a
good answer to the respective question.

  1. check if a
  2. check if b
  3. if neither a nor b, use the standard-snippet and move on.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

 **Example 1**
 
 Lore ipsum quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia
 consequuntur magni
 
 **Example 2**
 	    
 dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt,
 neque porro quisquam est,

.. warning::
   
   Examples are almost never examples for a complete answer of the
   section. They are examples for pieces that could, possibly, be part
   of an answer. We are lacking good examples. If you have written a
   data management plan, please consider donating it to the `Eawag
   Research Data Management Project \<rdm@eawag.ch\> <rdm@eawag.ch>`_
   so that we can improve this document.

Among the Examples are also 

.. admonition:: Eawag standard snippets
         :class: admonition-eawag-standard-snippet

	 Green boxes with text snippets, often Eawag specific.

We expect that those can be used in many cases verbatim, or with
little modification. **Please do not copy & paste blindy though**.
