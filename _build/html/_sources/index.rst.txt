Eawag SNSF DMP Guide
====================

.. centered:: Version |version| (2018-01-29)

.. sidebar:: Disclaimer
	     
    The instructions in this document are provided in the hope that
    they are useful to prepare the research data management plan
    that is required by the SNSF to be submitted along with project
    applications in mySNF starting Octber 2017. This guide is in part
    Eawag-specific.

    .. warning::
       
        **This document was not vetted by the SNSF, use at your own
        risk.**

This guide provides instructions for creating a data management plan
(DMP) as required by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as
mandatory part of grant applications.

The SNSF requirement for a DMP serves to implement it's `policy on
Open Research Data
<http://www.snf.ch/en/theSNSF/research-policies/open_research_data/>`_. Projects
that create a DMP, follow it and keep it up-to-date will be in an
excellent position to publish their research data as "Open Data" at
the end of the project, which is the main goal of SNSF's Open Data
Policy and can also have a number of advantages for the researchers
and institutions involved, e.g. a potentially increased citation rate
[Piwowar2013]_.

The other reason to implement a DMP is a better guard against data
loss, better chances for a maintained high data quality, more effcient
research organization and a better chance that the reserch project
stays within schedule.

A DMP should be regarded as a project management tool and exist as a
"living document" that prescribes and tracks all facets of data
management during the research data lifecycle. "Data" should be
seen as a ressource that needs to be managed, just as the
financial budget or human resources.


Please consult `this presentation
<https://eawag-rdm.github.io/eawag_dmp_2017/index.html>`_ for more
information about the new SNSF requirement and data management plans
in general.

Structure
=========

The structure of the document follows the mySNF form for the data
management plan.

.. container:: example
   
   **3. Data storage and preservation**
  
   3.1. How will your data be stored and backed-up?
    
   3.2 What is your data preservation plan?


Help text by the SNSF is quoted at the beginning of each section in a grey box:

.. admonition:: SNSF
		
        The SNSF explains how the question is meant.

Instructions
============

.. container:: example

   1. check whether a
   2. check whether b
   3. if neither a nor b, use the standard-snippet and move on.

Instructions contain step-by-step guidance on how to produce a
good answer to the respective question:


Examples
========

.. container:: example
   
   **Example 1**
 
   Lore ipsum quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia
   consequuntur magni
   
   **Example 2**
   
   dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt,
   neque porro quisquam est,

.. warning::
   
   Examples are almost never examples for a complete answer of the
   section. They are examples for pieces that could, possibly, be part
   of an answer. We are lacking good examples. If you have written a
   data management plan, please consider donating it to the `Eawag
   Research Data Management Project \<rdm@eawag.ch\> <rdm@eawag.ch>`_
   so that we can improve this document.

Among the Examples are also 

.. admonition:: Eawag standard snippets
         :class: admonition-eawag-standard-snippet

	 Green boxes with text snippets, often Eawag specific.

We expect that those can be used in many cases verbatim, or with
little modification.

.. warning::

   **Do not copy & paste blindy!**.
