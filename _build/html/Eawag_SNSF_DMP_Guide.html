<h3>Example snippets<a class="headerlink" href="#example-snippets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p class="rubric">Example 1 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#synthetic-chemistry" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The data produced from this research project will fall into two
categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The various reaction parameters required for optimization of the chemical transformation.</li>
<li>The spectroscopic and general characterization data of all compounds produced during the work.</li>
</ol>
<p>All data is tabular. Data in category 1 will be documented in [<em>file_format</em>].
Spectroscopic data in category 2 will be produced as [<em>file_format</em>]
and converted to [<em>file format</em>] for further use. Other
characterization data in this category will be collected in [<em>file_format</em>].</p>
<p>We anticipate that the data produced in category 1 will amount to
approximately 10 MB and the data produced in category 2 will be in
the range of 4 - 5 GB.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 2 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#drosophila" id="id3">[3]</a></p>
<p>This project will work with and generate four main types of raw data:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Images from transmitted-light microscopy of giemsa-stained squashed larval brains.</li>
<li>Images from confocal microscopy of immunostained whole-mounted larval brains.</li>
<li>Western blot data.</li>
<li>Results from LC/MS analyses of larval brains</li>
</ol>
<p>All data will be stored either in the format in which it was
originally generated (i.e. Metamorph files for confocal images;
Spectrum Mill files for mass spectra with results of mass spectra
analyses stored in CSV files; TIFF files for transmitted-light
microscopy), or will be converted into a digital form via scanning
to create TIFF or JPEG files (e.g. western blots or other types of
results).</p>
<p>Measurements and quantification of the images will be recorded in
Excel files. For long term preservation, they will be converted to
CSV files. Micrograph data is expected to total between 100 GB and
1 TB over the course of the project. Scanned images of western
blots are expected to total around 1GB over the course of the
project. Other derived data (measurements and quantification) are
not expected to exceed 10 MB.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 3 (modified from <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ethz-template" id="id4">[4]</a>)</p>
<p>The data are tabular health records generated by users of the
application X, which is deployed to 2 million users by company Y,
who will also collect the data from all users to provide us with
the complete dataset.</p>
<p>All fields contain user observations and are entered manually,
except for temperature, which is measured by a Bluetooth connected
thermometer. Data recording will take place over the course of three months.</p>
<p>Data fields per user: User identifier, Age, Weight, Size.</p>
<p>Six data fields per users per day of observation, which include one
numerical value (temperature), five values on a nominal scale,
e.g. “cervical fluid quality”, and one free-text field.</p>
<p>Data will be received in CSV format and has a total volume of about 15 GB.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 4 (from real Eawag DMP)</p>
<p>There will be two categories of data: NEW data from this project and
EXISTING data from the FOEN Lake Monitoring program. The NEW data will
consist of several file types, all CSV real number format, which are
all organized along the same principle: matrixes of times series with
various channels, each corresponding to a sensor (number of sensors
varies from 1 to10) and very different length, as the sampling
frequency varies by several orders-of-magnitudes. (i) 6 files of CO2,
DO, PAR and temperature (24 files at a time; Figure 2), each file only
1 sensor (Delta = 10 min; continuous), (ii) Thetis profiles
corresponding to time series (equivalent to depth series) of 10
sensors (Delta = 1 s; 5-10 times per day). (iii) 5 files of CO2 time
series for short-term surface flux measurements (several files, one
per month), (iv) meteodata file (eight sensors; continuous), (v)
T-Microstructure profiles files (6 sensors at 512 Hz; several files,
once per month) and (vi) excel files for individual chemical samples
(such as alkalinity, sediment trap estimates, ect; sporadic). The
EXISTING data is already available (CIPAIS, CIPEL) in excel sheets
with matrices for the individual samplings and a variable number of
parameters (~10 to ~25). The EXISTING data will not be modified and
remains with the organizations. We will keep a copy on our computers
during the project.  We anticipate the data produced in category 1 to
amount to several hundred MB for the moored and profiled sensor files
and ~100 GB for the T-microstructure profiles; the EXISTING data in
category 2 is in the range of ~20 MB.</p>

<li>Codes of good research practice that are being followed.</li>
<li>Quality control procedures such as plausibility checks, range check,
double data entry, statistical or visual outlier detection,

version-control system such as git, an Electronic LaboratoryNotebook /
Laboratory Information System (ELN/LIMS), etc.</p>
<p>Consider how the chosen organization schema supports version-control
(if necessary), collaboration (if necessary) and is suited for the
expected data volume and data structure.</p>

<h3>Example snippets<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p class="rubric">Example 1 (modified from <a class="footnote-reference" href="#synthetic-chemistry" id="id8">[2]</a>)</p>
<p>The reaction conditions will be recorded and collated using a
spreadsheet application. The resulting files will be saved in
directory, one for each scientist, with appropriately set file
permissions. A filename convention that encodes reaction, reaction
generation and date will be applied.</p>
<p>These directories will be mirrored to SWITCHDrive to for collaboration.</p>
<p>The various experimental procedures and associated compound
characterization will be written up using the Royal Society of Chemistry
standard formatting in a Word document, each Word document will also be
exported to PDF-A. The associated NMR spectra will be collated in
chronological order in a PDF-A document.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 2 (modified from <a class="footnote-reference" href="#drosophila" id="id9">[3]</a>)</p>
<p>All samples on which data are collected will be prepared according to
published standard protocols in the field [<em>cite reference</em>]. Files
will be named according to a pre-agreed convention. The dataset will
be accompanied by a README file which will describe the directory
hierarchy. Each directory will contain an INFO.txt file
describing the experimental protocol used in that experiment. It
will also record any deviations from the protocol and other useful
contextual information.</p>
<p>The format used for microscope images captures and stores a range of
metadata (field size, magnification, lens phase, …) with each
image. We will use a Python script that automatically extracts these
metadata and stores them together with the respective filenames in a
SQLite database.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 3 (from a real Eawag DMP)</p>
<p>The data from the moored sensors is sensor-internally stored and
recovered every two months, when sensors will be cleaned and
recalibrated if data indicates quality loss. The CO2 sensors will be
cross calibrated against atmospheric pressure. The DO and PAR sensors
in the mooring will be compared to profiled sensors and deviations
detected. Temperature sensors are extremely stable and are only
calibrated before and after the two years using the laboratory
temperature bath which is calibrated agaist the Office of Metrology in
Bern every few years to 0.001 oC.  The Thesis sensor data is
transmitted when surfacing via GSM communication system directly to
the lab where sensors deterioration is weekly checked. The instrument
will be retrieved every month and sensors cleaned. The optical sensors
will be calibrated according the manual every six months. The
T-microstructure sensors do not need calibration as the data is
matched to (very accurate) CTD temperature. Small T shifts are
irreverent, as only the spectra matter. The sensors deterioration (or
frequency loss) will visually be checked and is seen in the quality of
the Batchelor spectra.  The very simple structure of the CSV files
holding the raw data will be documented in a plain text README
file. This file, and all raw data files as they become available, will
be uploaded to the Eawag Research Data Institutional Collection into
one “data package”, which is annotated with general metadata.  Copies
of the raw data files as well as set of calibrated, quality-controlled
files stored on the group computers at EPFL will be organized in a
folder structure that is also documented in a README file. At the end
of the project, the entire set of calibrated, quality-controlled files
will be annotated and stored on the Eawag institutional repository as
well.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 4 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ethz-template" id="id10">[4]</a></p>
<p>All experimental data will be automatically imported into the
institutional electronic Laboratory Information System (LIMS) from the
measurement device. Methods and materials will be recorded using the
institutional Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN).</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 5</p>
<p>The sensor data are being fed into a Postgresql database running on an
institutional server. The database implements rules for basic validity
checks (range-checks, plausibility checks). The R scripts for data
analysis are stored in the institutional Git repository for version
control and collaboration.</p>

<h3>Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Conceptualize two types of metadata: <strong>1. Scientific metadata</strong> and
<strong>2.  General metadata</strong>:</p>
<p class="rubric">1. Scientific metadata</p>
<p>Scientific metadata provides all necessary information to correctly
understand, interpret, assess, replicate (within limits), build upon,
and generally use your data. This metadata might be compiled
“free-form” into a single README-file that accompanies the
data.</p>
<p>Certain fields have formally defined established metadata standards,
e.g. the <a class="reference external" href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/index.html">Ecological Metadata Language (EML)</a>,
the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.5.7/index.html">Open Microscopy Environment Schemas</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml">WaterML</a>. Mention
it, if you use such a standard. Have a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/">The RDA metadata
directory</a> for an
overview of existing standards.</p>
<p>This metadata could contain for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A description of the organization and relationships of the files or
database tables and other supporting materials.</li>
<li>Information about the naming convention (if applicable).</li>
<li>A mapping of data files to the corresponding section of the
associated publication, if applicable.</li>
<li>Information about units of measurements, variable definitions,
columns headings and abbreviations (if not present in the data-files
proper).</li>
<li>Information about the software (name, version, system environment).
used to produce and read the data (if the software is not included
as data).</li>
<li>Information about which files were used in what way at what stage of
the work.</li>
<li>Suggestions for how to best reuse the data.</li>
<li>Any information suited to decrease the chances that a future user of
the data needs to contact you with questions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric">2. General metadata</p>
<p>This type of metadata serves to make your data findable. It consists
of general attributes that help to search, sort, index, access and
propagate the dataset or collection of datasets. At Eawag, capture,
storage, formatting and dissemination of this metadata is handled by
the <a class="reference external" href="https://eaw-ckan-dev1.eawag.wroot.emp-eaw.ch/">institutional research data repository</a>. You might use the
<a class="reference internal" href="#eawag-standard-eric1"><span class="std std-ref">Eawag standard snippet “metadata in ERIC”</span></a>.</p>

<p class="rubric">Example 1 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#e-affinis" id="id13">[5]</a></p>
<p>We will first document our metadata by taking careful notes in the
laboratory notebook that refer to specific data files and describe all
columns, units, abbreviations, and missing value identifiers.  These
notes will be transcribed into a .txt document that will be stored
with the data file. After all of the data are collected, we will then
use EML (Ecological Metadata Language) to digitize our metadata. EML
is one of the accepted formats used in ecology, and works well for the
types of data we will be producing.  We will create these metadata
using Morpho software, available through KNB
(<a class="reference external" href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp">http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp</a>). The metadata will
fully describe the data files and the context of the measurements.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 2 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#synthetic-chemistry" id="id14">[2]</a></p>
<p>The data will be accompanied by the following contextual documentation, according to
standard practice for synthetic methodology projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>spreadsheet documents which detail the reaction conditions.</li>
<li>text files which detail the experimental procedures and compound characterization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Files and folders will be named according to a pre-agreed convention.
The final dataset as deposited in the institutional data repository will also be
accompanied by a README file listing the contents of the other files and outlining the
file-naming convention used.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 3 (from a real Eawag DMP)</p>
<p>For every data stream (sequences of identical data files) over the
entire 2-year period of data acquisition a README File will be
generated which contains: (a) the sensors used (product, type, serial
number), (b) the temporal sequence of the sensors (time and location,
sampling interval), (c) the observations made during maintenance and
repairs, and (d) details on the physical units, as well as the
calibration procedure and format. This is a standard procedure which
we have used in the past.</p>

<p class="last">Data will be stored on back-upped servers in the Eawag local
network. For file services and virtual server farm, Eawag shares a
server/storage platform (Netapp Metrocluster, Cisco UCS Server,
VMWare) with Empa. The backup procedure is fully automatic. Snapshots
of files are taken at least three times during a working day. All data
are mirrored synchronously between the two server sites on the
Empa-Eawag campus in Dübendorf. Additionally, backups (to disk) are
taken from the Metrocluster at a third location on the campus. Backups
are kept for three months. We have arranged to have access to the
required storage-capacity.</p>

<dd><p class="first">Export to CSV.</p>
<p>If you use Excel for data entry and storage, and follow the advice
in the excellent guide <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3183v1">Data organization in spreadsheets</a>, export to CSV
will pose no problems. Consider using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eawag-rdm/xlsxtocsv">xlstocsv</a> for doing that reliably
and comfortably.</p>
<p class="last">If you rely on Excel for data organization, annotation,
visualization, analysis or if you use macros or any advanced
features, it is likely not possible to export to a format suited
for sharing and preservation. In this case, save as <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">xlsx</span></code>
(not <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">xls</span></code>) and hope for the best.</p>
