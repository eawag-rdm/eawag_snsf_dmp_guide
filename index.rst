Eawag SNSF DMP Guide
====================

.. centered:: Version |version| (2018-01-09)

.. sidebar:: Disclaimer
	     
    The instructions in this document are provided in the hope that
    they are useful to prepare the research data management plan
    that is required by the SNSF to be submitted along with project
    applications in mySNF starting Octber 2017. This guide is in part
    Eawag-specific.

    .. warning::
       
        **This document was not vetted by the SNSF, use at your own
        risk.**


Instructions for creating a data management plan (DMP) as required by
the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) as mandatory part of grant
applications.

The DMP is both, a tool for the SNSF to implement it's `policy on Open
Research Data
<http://www.snf.ch/en/theSNSF/research-policies/open_research_data/>`_,
and a "living document" that prescribes and tracks all facets of data
management during the research data lifecycle. It should be regarded
as a project management tool that helps to manage the resource "data"
just like a project's budget is managed.

Next to ensuring data safety and quality and to help with an overall
smooth course of the research project, a main motivation for this new
SNSF requirement is to enable research groups to make their data
available as Open Data at the end of the project with only little
effort.

Please consult `this presentation
<https://eawag-rdm.github.io/eawag_dmp_2017/index.html>`_ for more
information about the new SNSF requirement and data management plans
in general.

	
Usage
=====

Structure
---------

The structure of the document follows the mySNF form for the data
management plan.

.. container:: example
   
   **3. Data storage and preservation**
  
   3.1. How will your data be stored and backed-up?
    
   3.2 What is your data preservation plan?


Help text by the SNSF is quoted at the beginning of each section in a grey box:

.. admonition:: SNSF
		
        The SNSF explains how the question is meant.


Instructions
------------

.. container:: example

   1. check whether a
   2. check whether b
   3. if neither a nor b, use the standard-snippet and move on.

Instructions contain step-by-step guidance on how to produce a
good answer to the respective question:



Examples
--------

.. container:: example
   
   **Example 1**
 
   Lore ipsum quia voluptas sit, aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia
   consequuntur magni
   
   **Example 2**
   
   dolores eos, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt,
   neque porro quisquam est,

.. warning::
   
   Examples are almost never examples for a complete answer of the
   section. They are examples for pieces that could, possibly, be part
   of an answer. We are lacking good examples. If you have written a
   data management plan, please consider donating it to the `Eawag
   Research Data Management Project \<rdm@eawag.ch\> <rdm@eawag.ch>`_
   so that we can improve this document.

Among the Examples are also 

.. admonition:: Eawag standard snippets
         :class: admonition-eawag-standard-snippet

	 Green boxes with text snippets, often Eawag specific.

We expect that those can be used in many cases verbatim, or with
little modification.

.. warning::

   **Do not copy & paste blindy!**.
